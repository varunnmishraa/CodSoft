"This repository contains code and projects from my internship on Java Programming at CodSoft. During my internship, I worked on several projects that allowed me to gain valuable real-world experience and apply my knowledge in a professional setting.

<br> The code and documentation here comes from the following projects I completed: </br>

<br>

<b>[ Project 1 : Student Grade Calculator ]</b> : In this project following features are added.  <br> Input - Take marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject.
<br> Calculate Total Marks - </b> Sum up the marks obtained in all subjects. </br>
Calculate Average Percentage - Divide the total marks by the total number of subjects to get the average percentage.
<br> Grade Calculation - Assign grades based on the average percentage achieved.</br>
Display Results - Show the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user.

<br> [ Project 2 : ATM Interface ] : In this project following features are added.
<br>1.Create a class to represent the ATM machine.
<br>2. Design the user interface for the ATM, including options such as withdrawing, depositing, and
checking the balance.
<br>3. Implement methods for each option, such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and
checkBalance().
<br>4. Create a class to represent the user's bank account, which stores the account balance.
<br>5. Connect the ATM class with the user's bank account class to access and modify the account
balance.
<br>6. Validate user input to ensure it is within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).
<br>7. Display appropriate messages to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure of their transactions.
